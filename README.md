 ## Bibliometric network analysis & topic modelling with metaknowledge
 
Bibliometric data from academic databases can be used to find relationships between metadata (authors, titles, citations etc.) and discover dominant topics. In this project, I use the Metaknowledge package and an information science and bibliometrics dataset from Web of Science to perform network analysis and LDA topic modelling, along with visualizations. 

This project was first published on Kaggle. The data and tutorials are available at https://github.com/mclevey/metaknowledge_article_supplement.
